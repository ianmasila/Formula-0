-----------------------------------------Interim Report I [10 April 2023]-----------------------------------------------
The following objects have been added as separate files in the project:
i.   object Game:          this object will hold the racing game attributes and functionality
ii.  object TextInterface: this object will implement the text interface of the game
iii. class Player:         this class will implement the player into the game
iv.  class Car:             this class will implement the race car into the game

These object have not yet been implemented. They are dummy classes as of now.
I have been prioritising other assignments thus I have not put much time into the project thus far.
I have spent perhaps 1-2 hours thus far.
I will implement the objects in earnest in the following days and weeks.



-----------------------------------------Interim Report II [23 April 2023]----------------------------------------------
Deleted unimplemented Car.scala and Game.scala files. Replaced with RaceCar.scala and whole.Formula0.scala implementing a skeleton of a race car and a race respectively.
whole.State design pattern is used for race car.
whole.Formula0.scala implements a transition state-space model of a formula racing game with actions and successor states.
Added Grid.scala substantially implementing a text-based racing grid.
Player class and interfacing class still needed in addition to increasing functionality of existing classes.
For instance, integration of player, race car, and grid instances is required to develop the game in whole.Formula0.scala.
Testing has been minimal (mostly experimenting with console) thus far due to the skeleton nature of implementation thus far. As advancements ensue, testing will become ubiquitous.
Potential errors may occur in movement of the race car along the race track. More inquiry is required to comprehend fully how direction and gear changes function.
The workload for this 2 week sprint has been approximately 10 hours of active coding and about 6 of research into design and implementation.
Race car movement remains a challenge to implement thus far, especially with the concept of "same direction".
